This past week, I’ve been actively exploring and refining a few of my projects. I’ve spent a good amount of time organizing branches and setting up the groundwork for new features in my epubreader project, which aims to enhance digital reading experiences. Along the way, I starred stonega/epubreader to keep tabs on some innovative ideas for e-book handling. My work on the ainput repository has been steady, focusing on maintaining a clean workflow and preparing for some upcoming updates. I’ve also been maintaining the notable project, making sure everything is stable and ready for future improvements. Although there haven’t been many code commits, I’ve been laying important structural foundations and planning next steps. It’s been a productive week of setup and preparation, and I’m excited for the coding sprints ahead. If you’re interested in e-book tools or productivity apps, I’d love to connect and share insights!
