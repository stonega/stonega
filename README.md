This past week, I’ve been hard at work refining my foliate.ai project. I pushed several updates and rolled out a couple of new releases, focusing on stability and prepping for new features. Most of my activity centered around deployment improvements and ensuring the release pipeline is smooth—lots of small but important tweaks behind the scenes. I’ve also been experimenting with foliate-js as part of my workflow, exploring better ways to integrate JavaScript components. While some of my pushes didn’t include direct code changes, they were vital for testing automation and build processes. This sprint has really helped me streamline how I ship updates and manage releases. I’m excited about the progress and the groundwork I’ve laid for upcoming features. If you’re interested in AI-driven reading experiences or release automation, let’s connect—I’m always open to collaboration and fresh ideas.
