This past week, I've been organizing my projects and setting up some groundwork for future development. Although I haven’t pushed any new commits to either my main repository (stonega/stonega) or my notebook tools repo (stonega/notebooklm-tools), I’ve spent time refining my workflow and planning out new features. I’m focusing on making both repositories more robust and easier for collaborators to jump in. In particular, I’m brainstorming ways to integrate more automation and streamline documentation. While there haven’t been code changes just yet, I’m excited about the ideas I have in the pipeline and I’m preparing to kick off some new updates soon. This planning phase is crucial for ensuring that my next pushes will be impactful. If you’re interested in productivity tools or knowledge management, keep an eye out for my upcoming work. I always welcome feedback and collaboration from fellow developers. Looking forward to sharing more concrete progress next week!
