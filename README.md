This past week, I've kicked off a new chapter in my xbit-bot project by creating a fresh branch. I'm excited about the possibilities this brings, as it sets the stage for experimenting with some new ideas and refining the bot's functionality. While it’s early days and I haven’t pushed any major changes yet, I’m already mapping out improvements that could make the bot smarter and more efficient. I always enjoy this phase, where planning meets hands-on coding. If you're interested in chatbots or automation, I’d love to connect and share insights. Stay tuned—I'm looking forward to making meaningful updates soon!
