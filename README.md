This past week, I've kept my projects up to date and made sure my repositories are organized, even though I haven't pushed any new commits. I’ve focused on maintaining my main repo, stonega, and the notebooklm-tools project, reviewing code and planning next steps. Behind the scenes, I’ve been mapping out new features and thinking about ways to enhance my workflow. My goal is to streamline future development and make my tools more robust for collaborators. While I haven’t released any major updates, I see this as an opportunity to refine ideas and prepare for more productive coding sessions ahead. Staying active on GitHub helps me stay motivated and connected to the community. I’m looking forward to sharing new progress soon and collaborating with others who are passionate about building useful tools. If anyone has suggestions or wants to team up, feel free to reach out!
