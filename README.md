This past week has been quite productive! I’ve spent a lot of time refining my foliate.ai and kitty.ai projects—two AI-driven applications I’m really excited about. On foliate.ai, I opened and merged several pull requests to streamline new features and improve overall stability. I’ve also pushed numerous updates to both repositories, keeping my workflow agile and iterative. For kitty.ai, I focused on code reviews and merging contributions, ensuring everything remains clean and efficient as the project grows.

Just a few days ago, I kicked off a new branch in my xbit-bot project, laying the groundwork for upcoming enhancements. It’s been rewarding to see these projects evolve through collaborative efforts and continuous integration. I’m always eager to experiment with new ideas and optimize performance, so every commit brings us closer to a more robust solution. If you’re interested in AI, bots, or just enjoy building smart tools, let’s connect—I love exchanging ideas and learning from fellow developers!
