I've been focused on refining my main stonega project, pushing several updates and experimenting with new features to enhance its functionality. I also spent time improving open-lovable, where I created a new branch and closed a key pull request to streamline collaboration. Recently, I dove into integrating Google Sign-In with Expo and continued iterating on getclay, always looking for ways to push my projects forward and explore new tech.
