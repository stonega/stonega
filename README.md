This past week, I've been laying the groundwork for some exciting updates across my projects. I created new branches in both my template-skills and xbit-bot repositories, setting the stage for upcoming features and improvements. While I haven't pushed any commits yet, I’ve been mapping out the architecture and planning my approach carefully—making sure everything is set before diving into code. The xbit-bot project, in particular, has some interesting possibilities around automation that I’m eager to explore further. It’s been a week focused on preparation and thoughtful planning, which I know will pay off once development kicks into high gear. Sometimes, investing time upfront in structuring branches and workflows makes all the difference down the line. I’m looking forward to pushing some meaningful updates soon and collaborating with others who share my enthusiasm for clean, scalable solutions. If you’re interested in automation or template-driven development, let’s connect—I’d love to hear your ideas!
