I've been diving deep into my stonega projects lately, focusing on refining features and streamlining workflows. Recently, I wrapped up a major update for open-lovable and explored new authentication patterns with expo-google-signin. It's been exciting to experiment with different branches and collaborate across repositories, and I'm learning a ton by iterating quickly and integrating community feedback.
