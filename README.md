Over the past week, I’ve been actively organizing and refining my projects, especially focusing on my xbit-bot repository. I created a new branch there, laying the groundwork for some upcoming features that I’m excited to roll out. Most of my activity has involved pushing updates and setting up the project structure, which is helping me prepare for more substantial development soon. I’ve also spent some time reviewing my kitty.ai project, making sure everything is in place before I dive deeper. Although there haven’t been any major commits yet, I’ve been busy planning and restructuring to ensure my next steps are well thought out. This phase has been all about laying a solid foundation and exploring new ideas. I’m looking forward to turning these preparations into real code and sharing more progress with the community soon. If you’re interested in bots or AI, I’d love to connect and collaborate!
