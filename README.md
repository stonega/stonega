This past week, I've been focused on my xbit-bot project, spending time refining its structure and preparing for new features. While I haven’t pushed any new commits just yet, I’ve been actively working behind the scenes—reviewing the codebase, planning enhancements, and organizing tasks for the next development sprint. I find this phase crucial for ensuring the bot remains robust and scalable. It’s exciting to map out improvements and think strategically about how to optimize performance. I’m looking forward to diving into coding soon and implementing some of the ideas I’ve been brainstorming. If you’re interested in automation or bot development, let’s connect—I’m always open to fresh perspectives and collaboration opportunities.
