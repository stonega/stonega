This past week, I've been diving deep into several projects that really excite me. I’ve focused a lot on improving my ainput repository, pushing multiple updates and opening several pull requests to refine its features and usability. I also spent some time enhancing notebooklm-tools, and I’m pleased with the progress I’ve made there—collaborating through pull requests has been especially productive. On top of that, I’ve been active on my notable project, opening new pull requests and pushing updates to streamline note management workflows.

A highlight was forking and contributing to foliate, an open-source ebook reader, which I’ve admired for a while. I starred the project as well, and opened a pull request to help with its development. It’s always rewarding to engage with other open-source communities and learn from their codebases.

Overall, it’s been a week full of coding, collaboration, and exploring new ideas. I’m always eager to connect with fellow developers who share an interest in open-source innovation!
