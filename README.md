This past week, I haven't made any new code commits, but I've been actively involved in the development process for my project, crane. I spent some time pushing updates and managing the repository, focusing on refining workflows and preparing for upcoming features. Even though there haven't been code changes, I've been reviewing the architecture and planning enhancements that will make the project more robust. Sometimes, progress happens behind the scenes—whether that's cleaning up branches or organizing tasks for future sprints. I’m excited about the direction crane is heading and am setting the stage for some impactful improvements in the next round of commits. Collaborators and contributors are always welcome, so if you’re interested in container orchestration solutions, let’s connect!
