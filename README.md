This week, I've been focusing on evolving my stonega project. Today was especially productive—I created a new branch to experiment with some fresh ideas, opened a pull request to kick off the review process, and successfully merged it after some careful consideration. I’ve made sure my workflow supports quick iterations and clean merges, which has helped keep the codebase organized. Collaborating—even solo—has been rewarding, as I get to refine my approach with every pull request. I’m always looking for new ways to improve the project structure and keep things moving forward. Earlier in the week, I pushed updates to the repository, laying the groundwork for these latest changes. I’m excited about the direction stonega is heading and am eager to explore new features soon. This period has helped me sharpen my skills in branching strategies and efficient code reviews. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to see what I’ve been up to, check out the latest activity!
