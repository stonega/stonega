This past week, Iâ€™ve been diving into two of my ongoing projects. Most recently, I pushed some updates to my FlClash repositoryâ€”Iâ€™ve been refining a few features and optimizing performance. Earlier in the week, I made a commit to xbit-bot, where Iâ€™m experimenting with some new automation strategies to make the bot smarter and more efficient. Itâ€™s been rewarding to see incremental improvements in both codebases, and Iâ€™m learning a lot as I iterate on these solutions. I always enjoy exploring new ways to streamline workflows and boost reliability. My focus has been on clean, maintainable code, and Iâ€™m open to feedback or collaboration from anyone interested in these projects. If youâ€™re passionate about automation or network tools, letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™m energized by the progress and excited to keep building.
