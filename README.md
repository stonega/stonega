This week, I've been busy refining my personal repository, stonega/stonega. I kicked things off by creating a new branch to test out some improvements. After making the necessary changes, I opened a pull request to get feedback and ensure everything aligned with the project's goals. Once I reviewed the code and was confident about the updates, I merged the pull request—streamlining my workflow and making the repo even smoother to work with. I've also been experimenting with the moltbot-railway-template repo, laying some groundwork for future automation and deployment strategies. Although there haven't been code commits yet in that template, I'm setting things up for a more robust bot deployment pipeline. Overall, it's been a productive week focused on enhancing my development processes and preparing for new features. I'm excited to see how these changes will help me collaborate more effectively and ship projects faster. If you're into automation or personal productivity tools, I'd love to connect and share ideas!
