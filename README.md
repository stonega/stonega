Over the past week, Iâ€™ve taken a step towards exploring new ideas by forking the stonega/sageread repository. Iâ€™m intrigued by the projectâ€™s approach and Iâ€™m eager to dive deeper into its codebase to understand its architecture and potential applications. Although I havenâ€™t made any direct contributions yet, Iâ€™m already brainstorming ways I might improve or extend its functionality. This fork marks the beginning of my next coding adventure, and Iâ€™m excited to see where it leads. If anyone else is working on similar projects or has insights about sageread, Iâ€™d love to connect and exchange ideas!
