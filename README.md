This past week, I've been actively engaged across several of my repositories, including ainput, notable, and xbit-bot. While I haven't pushed any commits with code changes recently, I've spent a lot of time planning, organizing, and refining project structures. My focus has been on brainstorming new features and optimizing workflows, especially for ainput, which is shaping up to be an exciting tool for streamlining input handling. I’ve also revisited notable, considering ways to enhance its usability and overall performance. Working on xbit-bot has given me some fresh ideas around automation and bot development that I’m eager to explore. Overall, it's been a productive week of behind-the-scenes work—laying the groundwork for bigger updates. Sometimes, the best progress happens during thoughtful planning and re-evaluation. I’m looking forward to turning these ideas into code soon. If you’re interested in collaboration or have suggestions, I’d love to connect!
