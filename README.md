This past week, I’ve been diving deep into my ainput project, experimenting with several branches and opening a couple of pull requests to refine some new features. I’ve been exploring ways to improve input handling and have actively pushed updates, even though most were focused on non-code changes like branch management and workflow tweaks. I starred the repository to keep it on my radar for further enhancements. On the notebooklm-tools side, I opened a pull request to address some integration points and made a series of pushes aimed at improving tool compatibility. It’s been an energetic week of prototyping and refining, especially around structuring my projects for smoother collaboration. I’m always looking for more efficient workflows and better ways to keep my codebase organized. If anyone’s interested in AI-driven input or productivity tools, I’d love to connect and share ideas. There’s plenty of room for fresh perspectives and contributions!
