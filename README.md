This past week, I've been busy refining my projects and setting the stage for new developments. Most recently, I created a fresh branch in my streamdown-native repository, laying the groundwork for upcoming features and improvements. Shortly after, I deleted some legacy code to keep things streamlined and maintainableâ€”I'm always striving for a cleaner codebase. Earlier in the week, I pushed updates to my stonega project, continuing to enhance its functionality and stability.

Through these activities, I've been focusing on balancing innovation with maintainability. I'm excited about the direction streamdown-native is heading and am actively experimenting with ways to make it more robust. Each change is a step toward delivering better solutions and learning new techniques. If you're interested in collaboration or just want to discuss modern native development, I'd love to connect and share ideas!
