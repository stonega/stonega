I've been focused on enhancing my main project, Stonega, with a series of updates and improvementsâ€”it's exciting to see the progress come together. Recently, I wrapped up a feature branch and pull request for Open Lovable, which helped me dive deeper into collaborative workflows. I'm also exploring authentication integrations in Expo Google Sign-In and continuing to iterate on Getclay, so there's been a great mix of building, refining, and learning new tech along the way.
