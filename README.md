This week, I've been focused almost exclusively on my clawearn project, keeping up a steady rhythm of activity and refinement. I created a new branch to experiment with some features and opened a pull request, which I later merged—so I’m pleased to see progress moving from concept to integration. Most of my commits have been zero-commit pushes, which means I’ve mainly been working on infrastructure, prepping branches, and syncing changes across environments. This careful groundwork is helping me keep the project well-organized and ready for more substantial updates. I’ve also been reviewing code and planning out the next steps for clawearn, aiming to streamline collaboration and testing. While it’s been a week of behind-the-scenes work, these efforts are laying the foundation for bigger changes ahead. I’m excited about the direction clawearn is heading, and I’m learning a lot about efficient Git workflows in the process. There’s been plenty of activity, even if it’s not all visible in code—sometimes the best progress happens
