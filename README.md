**Recent Activity Summary:**
Lately, Iâ€™ve been deepening my work on several projects, with a special focus on improving authentication flows in my new **expo-google-signin** repo. Iâ€™ve also made significant contributions to **open-lovable** and **getclay**, where Iâ€™m experimenting with new branches and closing out feature pull requests. Itâ€™s been rewarding to iterate quickly, explore fresh ideas, and collaborate across these projects as I expand my toolkit with modern React and Expo integrations.
