This past week, Iâ€™ve been exploring new opportunities to broaden my skill set. On October 22nd, I forked the freqtrade repository, which has piqued my interest in algorithmic trading and Python-based crypto bots. Iâ€™m excited to dig into the code and see how I might customize trade strategies or contribute improvements. Earlier in the week, I also engaged with my sageread project, although I didnâ€™t push any new commits this timeâ€”sometimes progress means planning and refining ideas before coding. Iâ€™ve been reviewing architectural choices and sketching out some enhancements for future updates. Overall, itâ€™s been a week of exploration and preparation, and Iâ€™m looking forward to sharing more substantial developments soon. If youâ€™re working on similar projects or have experience with trading algorithms, Iâ€™d love to connect and exchange insights!
